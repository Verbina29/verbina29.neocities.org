      <h2>Character Info</h2>

      <p>
        This is a page for quicker character info! It focuses more on personality and such than universe info. Characters with pronouns page sections or dedicated universe pages will have them linked on their info table. Some text might have weird quirks (such as Chroma's birthday and species fields changing when you refresh the page). Text like <span class="hoverable" title="Yep, like that.">this</span> can be hovered over for additional information (doesn't work on mobile). The characters aren't really ordered in any specific way, but they're color-coded based on universe. Uh. Lotta blue. Links on a character's name will take you to that character's section (not as useful on desktop). I didn't write any of this shit out in advance by the way.

          Chroma is a mostly normal robot that works as a bartender. Unfortunately for it, it's also a monster that has to eat someone roughly monthly to continue living. It feels terrible about doing this, and tries to block it out and ignore it for the most part.
          </p><p>
          It tries to be kind in its daily life, but it often feels like it's lying when it's being nice. It easily crumbles under pressure. When it's "stargazing" (what it tells people when it goes out to kill), or in related situations, it can be quite cold and calculating, brutally efficient in its violence. Its hobbies include reading, board games, and actual stargazing. It enjoys stories about sympathetic monsters or killers. It speaks with a noticeable American accent, and sometimes drops G's from the end of words.

            Gamemaster is the host of <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i>, a gameshow/reality TV show where it kidnaps various Contestants from across the multiverse and traps them in a killing game where they're forced to murder each other for the chance at a Wish and escape. Within the pocket dimension (the Zone) where it hosts this show, it's nigh-omnipotent, which it uses to grant the Wishes of anyone who manages to kill and get away with it. Unfortunately for those Contestants, anything it creates (and it can't do much other than creating physical things, at least in terms of things that can be taken outside of the Zone) that's taken out of the Zone usually stops working, so many Contestants that win end up getting scammed. Their fault for not reading the fine print (which is entirely unreadable, of course.).
            </p><p>
            It has an overly cheerful personality despite the content of its show, ending nearly every sentence in an exclamation point. It also has the ability to simply respawn when killed, and it has almost zero sense of self-preservation for its physical body due to this. It's the exact type of character to get shot to death and then walk back onto the stage, kick its own body to the floor, and keep talking as if nothing happened.
            </p><p>
            Outside of hosting <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i>, it has pretty much no life, and spends most of its free time trolling people on the multiversal internet. When not acting as the host of <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i>, it has a very trollish personality, and is generally an awful person to deal with due to its complete lack of any sort of ability to take things seriously.

          Percival is a freelancer that works with various multiversal organizations, mostly doing things that are either violent in nature or which could easily turn violent. This ends up being mostly mercenary work, with occasional work as an investigator, assassin, detective, and so on. They most frequently work with law enforcement agencies to apprehend multiversal criminals, but they don't actually have much of a sense of morality. As long as they're getting paid well, they'll break most laws.
          </p><p>
          They originate from a fairly <span class="hoverable" title='The popularity of Cyberpunk 2077 has ruined the word "cyberpunk" for me. Now everyone hears "cyberpunk" and thinks about the game.'>high-tech capitalist dystopia</span> universe with somewhat prevalent magic. They're fairly capable with magic, but only really know elemental attack spells, some light stealth magic, and a few general utility spells. The kite shapes of their "halo" are able to store magical energy, and the triangle is able to be extended out into a large, two-handed spear. Percival uses their spear as their primary method of casting magic, and the magic they use is primarily gesture-based. Their fighting style is flowy and somewhat dance-like. In fact, they actually study dance in order to improve their combat capabilities (or at least that's what they say, but they also just enjoy it on its own merit.). Their other main hobby is drawing, and they keep a sketchbook and pen in their coat. They're pretty capable in combat even without magic, as they're fairly nimble and have sharp senses. They mostly rely on agility to avoid taking hits in combat, but they're somewhat fragile when they do get hit. Their coat is lightly armored against magical attacks and slashes, but they don't have much other defense.
          </p><p>
          Since their head is a pocket watch, they make a faint ticking sound all the time, which is a little inconvienent for stealth missions. Despite having no mouth, they can speak perfectly fine, though only those with some form of magical affinity can understand them; to everyone else, their voice just sounds like the ticking of a clock. They know enough of most common multiversal sign languages to get by, but sometimes get different ones mixed up. They usually rely on writing when sign language doesn't work.
          </p><p>
          They have a fairly blunt, matter-of-fact personality, and avoid relying too much on their emotions. They have a tendency to think out loud, which isn't usually a problem due to most people in the areas that they work in lacking magical affinity. They speak fairly simply and often skip some less necessary words. They also have a tendency to make statements rather than asking questions.

          Damascus is my stupid little asshole vampire bird man. He's generally described by others as "pathetic", "cringefail", and "sopping wet", but that's not how he thinks of himself. He's incredibly self-centered, egotistical, and narcissistic, seeing others mainly as tools to be manipulated for his own gain. He has effectively no morals. Outwardly, he acts polite, but there's a barely-contained rage simmering beneath most of the time. He's kind of overdramatic and likes to do things like drink blood out of wine glasses and generally attempts to appear more sophisticated than he really is. He is generally an asshole and sometimes attempts to murder people over minor insults. He cares a decent amount about other people's opinion of him. His hobbies include reading, writing (mostly journals), and murder.

        <p>
          Errata is a highly trusted agent of the queen of Vania, currently tasked with subduing a potential rebellion in the Minn Kingdom. In executing this task, he utilized his illusion magic to pose as a trusted advisor to the previous king of Minn, and was able to convince the king to sign a contract that would grant Errata their position in the event of their death. After which, he killed the king, of course, making him the current ruler of the Minn Kingdom. Unfortunately for Vania, he's something of a double agent. His true allegiance lies with the Servants of the Anglerfish, a cult of fae contracted to an eldritch entity known as the Anglerfish. His allegiances don't actually conflict too much, though he's certainly planning to rebel against Vania eventually. As the leader of Minn, he has pretty much only done unethical things like forcing Minn's citizens to drown children. He also denies pretty much everything that comes across his desk and generally prevents anything productive from happening if it doesn't benefit his goals.
          </p><p>
          Personality-wise, he's pretty polite and formal. He can be pretty laid-back at times. He's manipulative, but in more of the way that he makes you think it was your idea. He's a bit smug at times, but gets easily flustered (he's just good at hiding it). He's somewhat insecure, and likes to be seen as important. However, beneath this surface there's a barely-contained eldritch madness, and he pretty much just bottles that all up until he has a mildly safe way to release it.
          </p><p>
          His true form is an only vaguely humanoid four-eyed shadowy tendril monster with an anglerfish-like lure and sharp, needle-like teeth. Of course, he uses his illusion magic to hide this and appear as he did before contracting with the Anglerfish. He almost never stays physically in the same place as his illusory form, and avoids attempts at physical contact at all costs due to this.

          Pisca honestly doesn't have a lot of lore. They're a faery that lives mostly in the mortal realm due to the whole. <a href="errata">Errata</a> situation. They don't exactly understand a lot of human culture but fae realm faeries would certainly think they spend way too much time around humans. They speak in a fairly modern manner most of the time, but often mix in archaic, flowery language. When talking about fae things they usually revert completely to archaic and flowery speech. She has a phone that was given to her by a human friend but doesn't really know how to use it all that well and said friend pays her phone bill. She mostly gets around the human realm on scooters or public transport. She's amphibious and can breathe water if she feels like it, which is an ability she gained from a contract with a sea serpent (which she um. may have killed people for. she um. kindaaaa lead a whole ship of people to their deaths for that. That's just the price you have to pay for power sometimes!). Also yeah the flipnote drawing is the only art I have of her.

        <p>
          Sedge, much like the rest of the Metalworks cast, is a college student researching magic. His main field of study is in magical plant creation and botany, with some work in consciousness transfer and other related topics. He created his current body utilizing much of his research, but he wasn't exactly the safest when actually transferring his consciousness to it. He didn't really... tell anyone he was going to do it, nor did he plan what he'd do afterwards.
          </p><p>
          Due to his plant body, he's able to photosynthesize, and he gets most of his energy from sunlight. However, he can still eat food (though it does feel weird for him to eat leafy greens, so he usually avoids them.) for extra energy. He pretty much only eats snack food like potato chips when he chooses to eat. If he's really low on energy, he'll instinctively root himself to the ground (This has happened indoors before.) to regain energy. His body doesn't really make a distinction between regular energy and magical energy, so if he needs to cast a big spell, he can just eat a bunch of snack food. This sometimes leads to his friends that are also researching magic giving him a bunch of snacks to use him as a mana battery. He doesn't totally need sleep, but it helps to conserve energy while the sun isn't out, so he usually does sleep. His body is somewhat fragile, since it's mostly plant matter with a wooden internal structure. It's not as hard to heal, though. He smells like freshly cut grass when injured, so he's always on edge near recently cut grass and has a slight aversion to the scent. His blood is dandelion sap. His body is mostly evergreen, but his "hair" flowers in the spring. The exact type of flowers is different pretty much every year, though, since his body is made up of so many different kinds of plants. The sedge flowers on top of his head are intended to look a bit like bunny ears, since he likes rabbits. Sedge is also his favorite plant, which is why he named himself that and used sedge flowers for the "bunny ears". Oh yeah, he's transgender. He actually transitioned after creating the plant body, so he has top surgery scars and such.
          </p><p>
          He generally has a tendency to underplan things and can be a little socially awkward at times. He's usually pretty kind, if a little shy, but really opens up once you get to know him. He occasionally likes to troll online plant identification communities by posting plants he created using magic. He used to have two pet bunnies named Sedgewick and Willow, but keeping pets that eat plants isn't exactly the greatest idea when you're made of plants, so he had to give them away to a friend. He's also the type of person to stay up all night cramming for an exam, though this causes him less problems than most people, since he can just eat a bunch of snacks to get energy.

        <p>
          Rika is another member of the magic research group. She's researching necromancy. Not really for any particularly deep reasons, it's not like there's someone in her life that died that she really cared about that drove her into necromancy research, it's more just a general desire to reverse death. She hasn't gotten particularly far in her research. She's been able to revive insects for quite a while (though she can't maintain them indefinitely), and she was able to revive a recently-dead cat for a couple minutes, which is the most groundbreaking thing she's done. She was very excited about it, but the student that had brought her the cat was incredibly disappointed. She's currently working towards trying to restart mana production in a dead creature and making the spells more efficient so that the spell can eventually be mostly self-sustaining.
          </p><p>
          She can be a little abrasive if you don't know her well, but she's pretty nice once you get to know her. She isn't exactly the most popular though, considering the whole necromancer thing. Unfortunately, most people think that necromancy is "dubiously ethical at best", "dark magic", and "probably not something a doctor should be doing". Ugh. She's pretty particular about hygiene considering that she works with a lot of dead animals for her research. Outside of school and research, some of her interests include: bad horror movies, casual video games, and cute fashion. She's decently skilled in self-defense, since she took a class when she was pretty young and has kept those skills around. In terms of her relationships with the rest of the Metalworks cast, she's pretty good friends with <a href="sedge">Sedge</a>, but doesn't get along the best with <a href="wulfric">Wulfric</a>. Her and Alexander work together a lot since there's some overlap between their fields of study, but they don't get along the greatest since their personalities kinda clash. Still, they manage to bond over shared interests like bad horror movies.

          Wulfric is a student researching wild magic illegally. He's in a pretty good position to do this, since he has some reasonably private land around his house (which he inherited). Most of the craters aren't visible from the street, at least. He has his house blurred on online satellite maps (which kinda only makes it more suspicious). He's also working on a spell circle to interfere with photography, which would absolutely only make him seem more suspicious. He's also a hobbyist blacksmith, so he can create the impure staffs needed to cast wild magic pretty easily.
          </p><p>
          He has wolf ears and a tail (as well as fangs and wolf-like natural hair coloration) from an (alleged, he jokes(?) that he was drunk at the time) wild magic accident. Wild magic seems to have something of a sense of humor. He has to hide this, since wild magic is very illegal, but he actually doesn't mind them. He normally just pins the ears down (hence why they have some light scarring on them) and wears a hat, and hides the tail under his coat or jacket. His hair used to be naturally blond, but he has to dye it now. He lets it grow out with the natural grey and white color in the summer though, he just says it's dyed. The ears and tail don't really seem to take to hair dye ever. To hide his fangs, he just uses a cloth face mask, since those are fairly socially acceptable in the modern day. Plus it just looks cool. His fingernails are also claw-like, but he usually files them down. He also has some light animalistic behaviors like panting when hot, and he has a larger appetite.
          </p><p>
          Personality-wise, he's a pretty laid-back guy. He's kind of messy and disorganized, leaving practically unreadable research notes scattered all over the place. He's pretty affectionate, even sometimes flirty, with his friends, though he's kind of just like that with everyone. He's a little paranoid, but it's sort of in the wrong ways. He's pretty good friends with Alexander, they're pretty supportive of each other's research and they generally get along well. <a href="rika">Rika</a> isn't exactly the biggest fan of him, and tends to avoid the topic of wild magic with him. He's good enough friends with <a href="sedge">Sedge</a>, they hang out occasionally.

        <figure class="floatLeft">

        </figure>

        <p>
          Periapsis is a sapient shapeshifting combat robot created by Periscope Systems, a military contractor specializing in robotics. It's made up of tiny nanobots, allowing it to easily and quickly manipulate its form. Since its consicousness is distrubuted across the nanobots, it's possible for it to split into multiple independent versions of itself, but it doesn't like doing this, as the split units generally are uncooperative and end up trying to kill it. Individual nanobots can be deactivated if desired, but it kind of hurts, so it usually avoids creating more nanobots than necessary. Its body is usually mostly hollow (sometimes appearing fleshy internally, since it was programmed to find gore pleasing to look at to encourage it to engage in combat), as it stores excess nanobots in tails. It sometimes stores things inside its hollow body. All of its forms include the logo of Periscope Systems somewhere, unless it actively tries to suppress it.
          </p><p>
          Periapsis has various Periscope-approved pre-programmed responses to questions, most of which it hasn't yet managed to program out. It wasn't really programmed with any sort of desire to kill, but it also wasn't exactly given a sense of morality. It doesn't really feel bad about the few people it's had to kill (though it does try to avoid that whenever possible). It was originally programmed to always follow orders, but it's managed to remove most of that after it escaped from Periscope's facilities. It was able to evade recapture by Periscope mainly by adopting human disguises and quickly learning human culture. After robots became commonplace, Periscope kind of had to stop trying to recapture it to avoid any potential backlash. They still occasionally send scientists to try to observe it from a distance, which Periapsis is very obviously aware of. It just wants to be left alone, damnit! It doesn't respond to its model name, only Periapsis and nicknames of it.
          </p><p>
          Periapsis is a little bubbly personality-wise, and is a bit of an optimist. It tries to speak in a normal way, but doesn't quite know what normal is, since most of its life was spent in a lab, so it ends up sounding clinical and distant at times. It has a tendency to misuse and misunderstand slang since it had to pick it up rapidly after its escape. It likes horror media and violent video games. It also enjoys designing new forms for itself. More generally, it loves trying new things, and wants to experience as much as it can.

        <figure class="floatLeft mini">

        <p>
          Apoapsis is also an experimental shapeshifting combat robot created by Periscope Systems, but it was more of a proof-of-concept of the nanobot idea. Its nanobots are much larger and visible to the naked eye, around ping pong ball sized. Due to this, it's less capable of precision shapeshifting and quick form changes. It also doesn't have the same distributed consciousness as <a href="#periapsis">Periapsis</a>, so the nanobots just fall apart when taken away from the main body. Periapsis and Apoapsis are completely intercompatible, and Apoapsis can use Periapsis's nanobots if desired or vice versa. They can also connect and exchange data directly.
          </p><p>
          Unlike Periapsis, Apoapsis wasn't originally sapient. It was intelligent, but only really intelligent enough to understand and follow orders. It became sapient when Periapsis transferred its more advanced AI to it during Incident-032 (an incident taking place shortly after its escape, where it came back to the facility to get various accessories that were created for it.), after which it continued to serve Periscope Systems out of its own free will. And maybe some sort of newfound desire for affection. The hug from Periapsis might've done something to it.
          </p><p>
          Apoapsis is generally overly clinical in tone, and often uses military terminology (even though it never experienced real combat, nor has it really been around actual military). It doesn't really understand social norms, and can come across as blunt or rude. It's somewhat curious about the world, but not nearly as much as Periapsis. It's somewhat pessimistic, and generally doesn't express much emotion. It doesn't have much self-identity outside of being the AP-0 APSIS unit.
          </p>
          <h3>these robots are queerplatonic, good for them</h3>
          <p>
          After Periscope Systems goes under, Periapsis and Apoapsis live together. They call themselves roommates, but their relationship could be described as queerplatonic partners. Periapsis often calls Apoapsis "Appy" or similar things, and is pretty affectionate with it. Apoapsis feels very purposeless, and Periapsis drags it to do various things and is generally attempting to help it find a new purpose in life. Periapsis, having lived around humans for longer, is a lot more experienced socially, but it still speaks fairly clinically when it isn't around Apoapsis. They feel comfortable around each other, and they're a little codependent.

        <p>
          Two is a pretty normal guy, aside from the whole being decapitated thing. He was killed by decapitation and then later revived as a vampire, and he's currently investigating his own murder. He has a conspiracy board about it. Since he was, well, decapitated, he doesn't really have any memory of his life before dying. He has frequent nightmares where he gets decapitated, but the details are never the same. He can't really control his current head, it just uses sympathetic magic to react to his emotions and such. He can't really talk through the head, so he has a spell infused into the gem on his jabot that lets him make his thoughts audible. The head also gives him normal senses and such. His vampirism and revival is basically a very complicated curse put on him. The same magic that revived him also locks his astral self into his body, so he can't astral project and such, making it a bit harder for him to do magic since he can't interact with manaweave as directly. He's managed to modify the manaweave of his vampirism so that he doesn't burn in the sun, but he does still drink blood. The particulars of how that works aren't important.
          </p><p>
          He currently runs a magic shop where he mostly removes curses and sells, maintains, and modifies various magical objects. He accepts blood as payment (and like, regular money.), and doesn't really see how it's any different from like, donating blood. He's offering a service for it too! He lives above the shop, and it's a pretty old building with a generally antique-shop sort of vibe. <a href="#kiro">Kiro</a> is his assistant and shop mascot. Sometimes various people stand outside the shop and stare at him, but no two are ever the same. Two's current theory on this is one or more shapeshifting stalkers.
          </p><p>
          Two is generally pretty kind and relaxed. He's passionate about magic, and enjoys his work. Due to the way the magic that lets him speak works, he has a tendency to run on when talking, and has a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of speaking at times. He doesn't exactly like this, and he also kind of hates the way his head reacts to his emotions. He finds it particularly annoying when it decides to nod or shake, since it disrupts his viewpoint unexpectedly. His sense of right and wrong is fairly strong, though it does maybe bend a little under his vampirism. It's not exactly the most ethical to accept blood as payment for curse removal...

        <h3>Alder</h3>
        <p>
          Alder is Two before they died at <a href="#perima">Perima</a>'s hands. He's actually the cause of many of the curses that Two deals with, unbeknownst to them. He was immortal, and used the mana stolen from his curses to fuel his immortality spells. The main cost of his immortality, other than the mana, was that he had to sleep a lot. Most of the curses he cast were bloodline curses, so after he had cast enough curses to maintain his immortality spell, he became a recluse and mostly stopped cursing people. He's not very moral, but there are certain lines that he won't cross (like hurting animals or betraying others). In the later years of his life, he was dating Perima. She mostly tried to help him get with the times, though he was still pretty reclusive. He spoke pretty formally and used a lot of commas and em-dashes, and generally kinda ran on. Even though it was only like twenty years max between his death and revival, no one really remembers him since he was so reclusive.

          Kiro is some sort of psychic cat-like thing that serves as <a href="#two">Two</a>'s magical assistant and shop mascot. Since he doesn't have a mouth, he communicates exclusively through telepathy. His telepathy extends to dreams, so he sometimes helps Two with their nightmares. As a magical creature, he runs on mana, and he has the ability to absorb things with his little paws and convert them into mana. This is sort of equivalent to eating for him, but he doesn't really have any sense of taste. He usually just absorbs something energy-dense (like fuel) every once in a while. He also has telekinesis, but it's not very precise. It can only pick up all the objects in a radius of around a foot, so objects clustered together will get picked up. He can easily paw things out of the telekinesis, and they'll generally fall out if pushed against a solid object. Also, he has a beam attack.

          Kiro generally has a fairly cat-like personality. He enjoys lounging around the shop, grooming himself, and greeting customers. He's fairly lazy, and can be somewhat selfish, but he also likes being helpful and likes to be seen as such. He's fairly agreeable and often simply goes along with what others say, but he can be a helpful advisor if he wants to be. He speaks somewhat formally, but his manner of speaking isn't usually archaic.

          Peresk is a forest guardian. They're the leader of a group of forest creatures and such, using their plant manipulation abilities to craft homes for their fellow forest-dwellers. They also have a human-sized mecha that they use when going out into the city, which they mostly do to run errands and such. They don't really like using the mecha, but the city isn't exactly made for animal-esque creatures, so they sort of have to. They don't really have a ton of lore. They speak in a fairly archaic and formal manner, but don't talk very much outside of their community. They're very protective over their forest and its inhabitants.

          Perima is sort of a weird little yandere. She doesn't really see other people as real people with their own independent thoughts and lives, aside from whoever she's latched onto for the moment (which is currently Alder/Two). Usually this person is somewhat evil, and she's usually romantically interested in them to some extent. She's cheerful to a somewhat disturbing degree, sort of sickly-sweet, but she frequently acts shy and nervous to seem less intimidating or suspicious. She doesn't actually need the glasses she wears, they're just to make her seem like more of a shy, harmless nerd. She's a pretty good actor, and good at impersonating people, though her real personality sometimes bleeds through. She doesn't really feel any need to be kind to others, so her cheerfulness is almost entirely an act. She's inexperienced in magic, and doesn't really know the difference between real magic and <span class="hoverable" alt="Like psuedoscience, but for magic.">psuedomagic</span>, leading her to often hire fake mages to cast love spells and the like on Two. She's not really romantically interested in Two, she sees him more like one might see an interesting bug. She wants to put him in a box and shake it. She often stalks him, though always while disguised, and she rarely interacts with him directly, preferring to observe him from a distance. She does occasionally enter his shop while disguised, though.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perima dated Alder for a period, but he broke up with her after learning that she had crossed a moral line of his. Perima eventually mostly got over it, but couldn't really forgive him. So she decided to murder him, obviously. She decapitated him with an axe and buried his body in the forest (after dissecting it.). She kept his head, preserved with magic. Sometimes she kisses it. At some point after killing him, she couldn't stand living without him anymore, and hired a mage to revive him as a vampire. She hoped this would make him more evil (and more interesting), but it unfortunately seems to have backfired.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a genetic slime, Perima has to absorb organic material to maintain her mass. In practice, this means she just absorbs people around every other month. After absorbing someone, she can transform into them perfectly. She often finds people to absorb at speed dating events and such. After absorbing someone, she usually impersonates them for a period. Officially, she works at a genetic research lab, but she ends up spending a decent amount of her time impersonating others and working their jobs. The only reason she hasn't been fired from her job is that when she bothers to come in, she usually brings insane breakthroughs.

          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, blah blah blah. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
