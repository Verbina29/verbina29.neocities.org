It has a gray background, black orbits, and white labels. Planets listed going outwards from the center. The innermost orbit is of the suns, Thetyx and Notyx. Notyx is a pale yellow, while Thetyx is a pale blue. Orbiting Thetyx is Aher, a dark reddish-brown planet. Every other planet orbits around both suns. The second planet from the suns is Nesoa, a light tan planet with two moons, Tazeltia and Valberien. Valberien is a light rusty orange, while Tazeltia is a pale cyan. The third planet from the suns is Ciphin, a blue planet with no moons. The fourth planet out is Fexmus, a green planet with three moons; Silvius, a dark green moon; Vipin, an orange moon; and Codrin, a cyan moon. The fifth planet from the suns is Evmir, a purple planet with seven moons. Going counter-clockwise from the leftmost moon, you have Myasis, a white moon; Kuvtia, a bright red moon; Aen, a bright yellow moon; Vitone, a bright lime green moon; Lutia, a bright cyan moon; Cimnos, a bright blue moon; and Nadite, a bright magenta moon. The final and farthest out "planet" is Dureus, a tiny black hole. Orbiting it is a binary system consisting of Codos, a larger sea green planet, and Milena, a small dark red planet.'></a>

It is a desert planet with many oases. Its climate is quite warm, but not so hot as to be uninhabitable for humans and similar species like Aher is. The sands of Nesoa are very rich in silicon, so its inhabitants are able to make a lot of technology. Nesoa has two moons, Valberien and Tazeltia. The main inhabitants of Nesoa are slimes, but some other species (mostly humans) live on it as well.</p>

It's almost entirely ocean, with only a few small island chains. The islands it does have are all tropical, so it's a common vacation spot. It has no moons, so its tides are much weaker than Earth's. This makes it a great place for water-dwelling species to live, as they won't get swept away by strong tides.</p>

Its native inhabitants are fairies, but it also has a high population of other species, as its mild climate means that all species can easily and comfortably live on it. Fexmus has four seasons, just like earth. It has three moons, Silvius, Vipin, and Codrin.</p>

                          <p>The Seicreth Alliance, or just Seicreth is a country on Fexmus. It's made up of 14 states with 25 districts each. Its system of government is <s>so fucking complicated. why do i have three entire paragraphs on its system of government???</s> democratic, and they have yearly elections, which also serve as a census to redraw the borders of the districts such that they all have equal population because voting is mandatory. Districts and states get representatives that vote on and propose laws. They have free healthcare and universal basic income and all that good stuff. 
                          <br> It was formed by an alliance between the countries Sei and Creth, and its two capitals are named after these two countries. Its currency is the Blossom, and Blossom coins are shaped like flower petals.
                          <br>And finally, the part you've all been waiting for. What does that flag up there mean??? The blue stripe is the Selere River that once seperated Sei and Creth, the green is the lush forests, the two stars represent the two countries, their white color represents the peace between them, and the seven points add up to equal the 14 states. The red between the stars represents the blood spilled in the wars before the formation of the Alliance. Also, the stars kinda look like wolves. :)</p></div>

It has a grey background, black lines, and white text with a small black outline. The diagram consists of a hexagram (more commonly known as a Star of David) with a circle at each point. Going clockwise from the top, the labels and icons inside each circle are as follows: "Light", with a bright yellow, thin eight-pointed star for the icon; "Earth", with a bright lime green three-leafed plant for the icon; "Water", with a bright blue wave for the icon; "Dark", with a bright magenta spiral for the icon; "Air", with two bright cyan gusts of wind stacked atop each other for the icon; and "Fire", with a bright red flame for the icon. The alternate version changes the labels and some of the icons, but keeps all the colors the same. This alternate version is as follows, still clockwise from the top. "Energy", with a lightning bolt icon; "Nature"; "Ice", with a snowflake icon; "Void"; "Wind"; and "Lava", with a slightly wavy pool of lava for the icon.' title="sometimes, i just move my mouse in and out of this diagram. it's kinda fun.">
              </div>
              <p>Ryva's magic system is based on the six elements shown in the diagram above. The alternate names are still the same element, just under a different name. In-universe, there would probably only be one word for each element. The elements that are across from each other can be considered "opposites", but the arrangement is otherwise meaningless. Each of Ryva's races (except humans) has an affinity for an element which makes their magic much stronger when using that element. They can learn other types of magic, but these are weaker, and the opposing element to the affinity will be so weak that it's useless. Humans have no affinity, and can learn all types of magic, but it's weaker.</p>

                        <p class="content-small">Basic elemental magic can do two things. The most basic thing it can do is control things associated with an element. So water magic can control water, nature magic can control plants, etc.. Pretty simple stuff.

                        <br>
                        The other thing basic magic can do is "create" things associated with an element, but this always costs exponentially more than doing something else with an equivalent result. So "creating fire" is always going to be much harder than "lighting something on fire".</p>

                        <p class="content-small">Advanced elemental magic can be boiled down to two things. It can do things associated with an element, or it can apply things associated with an element to other things. The first kind of things associated with an element can be called "Exceptions", and the second type can be "Aspects". The second kind of advanced magic is called "Enchantment", but the first kind doesn't have or need a name.</p>

                        <p class="content-small">Exceptions and Aspects are decided by the god Evmir, who writes them in the six Elemental Tomes. Anything written in one of the Tomes irreversibly becomes true, as the Tomes cannot be erased. There's also a seventh, non-elemental Tome which decides what magic as a whole can do. New Aspects and Exceptions can be suggested to Evmir, and if the suggestion makes sense, they'll write it in the appropriate Tome, making it truth. One could also theoretically steal one of the Tomes and write in it, but this would be nearly impossible.</p>

                      <summary class="subtitle">Magical Energy</summary>
                        <p class="content">Magic costs magical energy to use. It's measured with the Enerk, which is equivalent to the average amount of latent magical energy in the human body. Most people have around one Enerk of magical energy, but it varies from person to person, and some species have generally higher or lower latent magical energy. Latent magical energy can be used to do magic, but depleting it entirely causes you to pass out until you recover some of it. Depleting it repeatedly has symptoms similar to those of sleep deprivation, but can lead to death or worse. 
                        <br>There's also magical energy in the world itself, but it's spread very thin. Depleting the energy in an area causes it to become uninhabitable for animals and kills any plants in the area, and the depleted patch will stay like that until the energy rebalances, which can take years. It's theorized that the magical energy in the world itself is left over from the creation of the universe.
                        <br>The other two forms of magical energy have heavy consequences for usage. They are life energy and soul energy. The average sapient being contains roughly ten Enerks of life energy. Using all of it up at once kills you instantly, obviously. However, using it up slowly turns you into an undead creature. The average soul contains one hundred Enerks of soul energy. Depleting a soul of energy destroys it, and if the soul was that of a person, they become an Elemental of their magical affinity. Elementals are monsters that attack people with magic in an attempt to obtain a soul. If they obtain a soul they die.
                        Magical energy can be stored in magic crystals, which form naturally in areas with excess magical energy, or can be created by crystallizing magical energy. They change color depending on the type of energy stored in them. Life energy is red, soul is blue, world is green, and normal energy is white. These crystals shatter violently if all the magic stored within them is depleted.</p>

                        <p class="content-small">Rituals allow one to commune with gods and demons and summon angels and minor demons. Rituals use a magical circle drawn in a material that is either heavenly or demonic, and require energy stored in crystals to maintain. Summoning rituals require evidence of a good or bad deed to start depending on whether you wish to summon an angel or a demon (I might change this though), while communing rituals require something associated with the god or demon you wish to commune with to start. Communing rituals require a larger circle than summoning rituals. There's also the dubiously canon dimensional travel ritual.</p>
