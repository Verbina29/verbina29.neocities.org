          <a href="artGallery/Abby_v_Pachriel.png"><img src="artGallery/Abby_v_Pachriel.png" alt="A fully shaded digital painting of Pachriel and Abby fighting in a brightly lit gazebo covered with ivy. The background is a bright blue sky that appears to actually be a screen, and the ground is grassy. Pachriel is an angel wearing white armor with gold details and a pink skirt with heart patterns, and golden leg and arm armor. She has a golden helmet with golden laurel-like detail and an owl-like face with no mouth. She has transparent pink and pale yellow wings and halo. She's floating slightly above the ground and holding a large black and neon green hammer with roses on it. Abby is a digitigrade TV headed robot with a dark gray body and a cable tail with two ends. Its head is brown with cream trim and two black and white knobs, with loopy antennae. Its screen displays a scribbly red X. It has V1 from ULTRAKILL's wings, four orange and yellow blades on each side with blue bases, and its left arm is replaced with the Feedbacker arm from ULTRAKILL, which is black with blue armor panels on the lower arm and back of the hand, and there are two red tubes on it. It's wearing navy pants and a navy hoodie, with a long black trenchcoat with a navy belt over top. Its clothing is slightly tattered, and its left sleeves are torn off to show its Feedbacker arm fully. It's holding the Marksman revolver from ULTRAKILL and firing it at two mid-air coins, causing the projectile to ricochet towards Pachriel with a yellow trail. Abby is also doing the cool pose from the ULTRAKILL: INFINITE HYPERDEATH album cover or at least as close to it as I could manage with the digitigrade legs."></a>

Floating above his head is a purple television, with light blue feathery &quot;ears&quot; on either side, and two antennae flopping down behind his head. He's wearing gray pants and a pale blue shirt that has small flaps to let his tails move, and slits for his wings. He's facing away from the camera, looking up slightly at a conspiracy board with many polaroid photos and labels connected with red string. He's holding a photo of a catlike yellow animal with bunny ears and orange sparkly eyes (his name is Kiro but he's not important here.). On the conspiracy board is a section labeled &quot;STALKERS&quot;, with 3 photos of humans looking directly at the camera, 1 photo of an orange anthro cat looking directly at the camera, and one almost entirely obscured photo (but it's a dog. just a normal dog. still looking directly at the camera.). They're all connected together, and to a pin in the center, which connects to the label, to another label reading &quot;shapeshifter?&quot;, and to a photograph of a two-story building with an awning. This photo is connected to a large, central piece of paper that just has a large black question mark on it. Most of the labels connect to this paper. Connected to that, and mostly obscured by Two's arm, is a label reading &quot;KILLER&quot;, connected to a &quot;REVIVER&quot; label, and these two are connected to a label reading &quot;same person?&quot;. Connecting to the &quot;REVIVER&quot; label is a photo of Two's neck stump, which connects to a picture of an axe with a question mark over it, which both connect to a label reading &quot;DREAMS&quot;, as well as several offscreen things. The &quot;REVIVER&quot; label also connects to a &quot;VAMPIRISM&quot; label, which connects to a photo of a person-sized hole in the ground, which connects to a forest. All of the photos and other things are pinned to the board with red, green, blue, and yellow pushpins. The room has brown wallpaper, and dark brown trim at the bottom, as well as a lighter brown wooden floor. The conspiracy board has tan cork and a dark brown frame."></div></a>

The fur on their stomach is a pale creamy brown, while the fur on their back is a light orangey brown. The legs on their right side are a light brown, and the legs on their left side are a slightly darker brown. They also have a bit of fluffy dark brown fur around their neck. In one of the drawings, they're standing normally on four legs, facing right. In the other, they're standing on two legs, piloting a humanoid mecha with digitigrade legs. The mecha is simple and exoskeleton-like, and you can see Peresk through it easily. It's made from various shades of bluish gray metal, giving it a somewhat thrown-together appearance. It has two-fingered hands with opposable thumbs, and a small platform with reddish treadmills for the pilot to walk in place on. On the backs of Peresk's legs, there are dark gray exoskeleton-y thingies to control the mecha's arms and legs with. Their front paws, tail, and head all stick out of the mecha."></a>

Printed on the side is a very pixelated, nigh-illegible version of the Aurashade Research logo, a pale purple four-pointed slanted star inside a gear, with a long stylized arrow pointing all the way to the barrel of the gun. The background is black and glossy, with a distorted reflection of the gun showing on the surface it's set on."></a>

Gamemaster is wearing a black single-breasted trenchcoat with a navy belt, navy pants, and a navy hoodie underneath; It seems satisfied with the outfit. Chroma is wearing a pale purple dress shirt with a blue tie, with dark purple pants, and a desaturated purple vest over it, with a purple suit jacket with coattails that have a blue diamond pattern open over it; It seems to dislike the tie, and is posing kind of like one of those videos of cats wearing socks, you know the ones."></a>
