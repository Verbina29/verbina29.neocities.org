          <h2>Gamemaster!!!</h2>
          <p>
            Gamemaster is just a <s>silly little TV head robot</s> highly wanted multiversal criminal. It is the sole host and creator of a <s>perfectly legal</s> highly fucking illegal multiversal gameshow entitled <i class="hoverable" title="And yes, it has to be italicized. (Not actually, but Gamemaster always italicizes it, when possible.)">Gamemaster's Zone</i>, in which various Contestants are <span class="hoverable" title="Gamemaster denies these allegations.">kidnapped</span> from across the multiverse and forced to kill each other for the chance to obtain a Wish. Gamemaster maintains that this is perfectly legal, and will produce appropriate corroborating evidence (almost certainly fabricated out of thin air) if asked. According to it, all the Contestants have signed contracts (They absolutely have not. They all have absolutely zero memory of this.).
          </p>
          <p>
            During <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i>, it (usually) acts like a cheerful gameshow host, ending almost every sentence with an exclamation mark (even when it's saying things that very much do not match its cheerful tone.). Outside of <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i> (and sometimes during it), it takes on a much more casual, almost internet troll-like personality. It's also very silly. It's just a silly little guy! It has several Bits that it does, like how it never sits on a chair. Its weapon of choice is a giant squeaky hammer (which it can use even outside the Zone. It's able to take the hammer out of its screen whenever it wants in the form of a small silver disc which expands into the hammer when pressed.), which it does various cartoon bullshit with, but it also can absolutely just Kill People with it if it wants to. Also, it often displays emoticons on its screen. It's a big fan of :3ing when doing/saying Absolutely Awful Shit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gamemaster is nigh-omnipotent while within the Zone, its pocket dimension. It uses this nigh-omnipotence to (try to) grant the wishes of any Contestant that manages to win <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i>, but as it only has this ability while within the Zone, many wishes will not actually be fulfillable by it. Additionally, any items taken out of the Zone are modified to fit the rules of the universe that they're brought into, which significantly limits its wish-granting ability. It's pretty much limited to making physical items. It's very much a con artist with the Wishes. If the wish is actually something it can fulfill, it will very much go by the spirit of the wish, but if it's something it knows it can't do, it'll resort to genie-esque intentional misinterpretation. It's also able to relatively freely travel the multiverse, but it can't control precisely where it ends up. It'll usually end up in a population center, at least, and if it thinks of a particular person (or a vague idea of a person), it'll end up pretty close to them. Gamemaster is also effectively immortal, as if it's destroyed (or it somehow loses its connection with the Zone), a new body (it refers to them as shells) will be generated in the Zone, and its consciousness and memories and the like would be transferred to it effectively instantaneously. If it were somehow unable to reach the Zone, it would stop considering itself Gamemaster, and only the new Gamemaster would consider itself to be Gamemaster. The new Gamemaster, Gamemaster Prime, if you will, will usually attempt to retrieve the memories and such of the disconnected Gamemaster by any means necessary. Due to this form of effective immortality, Gamemaster doesn't actually see its body as itself, and has been known to simply destroy itself in order to get out of situations it doesn't want to be in when outside of the Zone.

        <section><!--the Zone-->
          <h2>the Zone!!!</h2>
            <p>
              The Zone is Gamemaster's pocket dimension, in which it hosts <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i>. Gamemaster is nigh-omnipotent within it, able to modify the layout and physics and the like at will.
            </p>
            <p>
              When not running <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i>, the Zone is usually just a void of TV static that solidifies into solid white wherever you step. The "outside" of it, the area outside of the boundaries of the game, also looks like this.
            </p>
            <p class="final">
              During <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i>, it's a series of rooms, similar to a reality TV house in layout, usually slightly non-Euclidean in nature. The walls are usually just plain white, darkening slightly at the edges, and most of the furniture and such is in Gamemaster's signature blues and purples. There's also always an infinite hallway, just for funsies. There's also usually an elevator that leads to a room for every Contestant, with minimalist, single-color symbols representing each Contestant as the buttons. Gamemaster also has a room, which is entirely for the aesthetic. Gamemaster's room is a surveillance room sort of thing, with a large bank of CRT monitors that display all the various rooms of the Zone, and a large bank of random buttons and knobs and sliders and the like. Unlike the majority of the Zone, the walls of this room are dark grey, rather than white.

          <h2>Gamemaster's Zone!!!</h2>
          <p>
            <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i> is a <span class="hoverable" title="It could also be considered a reality show.">gameshow</span>, distributed online throughout the multiverse. The rules of <i>Gamemaster's Zone</i> are easy to sum up. Kill someone, and recieve a <span class="hoverable" title="They're capitalized for Legal Reasons.">Wish!!!</span> Of course, it <i>is</i> more complicated than that.
          </p>
          <h3>Rules!!!</h3> <span class="hint">The detailed version.</span>
          <ul>
            <li>Any Contestant(s) that commit a murder get a Wish and the ability to escape the Zone once voting has concluded, if they were not the one(s) voted for.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Multiple Contestants can commit a murder together (counted primarily by planning together, they don't strictly have to kill the person together.), but a maximum of two people can get a Wish from one murder.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Only people directly and intentionally involved in the murder can get a Wish. This means that making someone accidentally or unknowingly kill someone else would still get you the Wish, and the actual killer wouldn't get the Wish.</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>Contestants can call a vote from their miniGMs at any time, but require a majority for the vote to actually begin.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Only one vote can be called per murder, unless multiple people are involved, in which case as many votes as people involved can be called.</li>
                <li>If a killer is voted for, they'll be punished.</li>
                <li>If the Contestants don't vote for the killer, they are punished instead.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <p class="final">Okay, when I write it out like that it's actually not that complicated. The rules seen in-game are more abridged, and clearly actually written by Gamemaster.</p>
