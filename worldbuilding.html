      <summary>So, what kind of world is it?</summary>
        <p>Ryva is a science fantasy world, centered around the solar system which is also called Ryva. There's at least three things called Ryva (being the goddess Ryva that created the world, the world itself, and the solar system the world is centered around.) I'm using the term "science fantasy" here, but I'm really using it to mean "sci-fi but with magic".</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Are you writing a book or something?</summary>
        <p>Nope! I just worldbuild for the sake of worldbuilding. I would <i>love</i> to make a game taking place in it, but I don't have the motivation or the skills to do what I want to do with that.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Ah, so it's a solar system? Do you have any diagrams of it?</summary>
        <p>I've been working on a more scientifically accurate and to scale version in Universe Sandbox, but until I finish that, all I have is this definitely not anywhere near to scale diagram.</p>

      <summary>Alright, so what exactly are all those labeled circles in that diagram?</summary>
        <p>Thetyx and Notyx are the twin suns, named after the sun gods. Or maybe the gods were named after the suns? Really, who knows.<br>
        Aher is the hottest planet in the system. It has seas of lava, and parts of its surface melt in the summer. Dragons live on it. It's named after the god of fire.<br>
        Nesoa is the desert planet. It's named after the goddess of deserts and sand. Slime people live on it.<br>
        Ciphin is the ocean planet. It's named after the goddess of water. I'm sure you're able to start seeing a pattern here. All the planets are named after the gods and goddesses that created them. Or maybe the planets created the gods. It's not exactly clear. A "chicken or the egg" debate, really. Anyway, mermaids live on it, but I don't like them very much. I haven't thought of something cooler to replace them with yet.<br>
        Fexmus is the most Earthlike planet in the system. Faeries (or Fairies, however you want to spell it, really.) live on it. Humans also live on it, I guess. But they pretty much live on every planet. Anyway, Fexmus is the god of nature and forests.<br>
        Evmir is the magical planet. It's also quite snowy. Half-animal people live on it. The "polite" term for them would be Therians, but that doesn't really tell you much. Really, just imagine catgirls, catboys, and nyan-binaries. Except also imagine those with other animals. I just don't have any puns for other animal versions.<br>
        Dureus is a black hole! I think that's neat. It's named after the god of the dead and judgement.<br>
        Milena... Let's not talk about Milena.<br>
        <details>
          <summary><sub>... What's the deal with Milena?</sub></summary>
            <p>The planet, or the goddess?</p>

      <summary>I want to know more about Ryva's species.</summary>
        <p>Dragons are winged, fire-breathing reptilian creatures that vary heavily in size, ranging from the size of a small dog to that of a large house. Dragons hibernate during Aher's hottest season, spending their time in the previous season hoarding gems to eat during hibernation. Dragons also are able to change into a humanoid form, which is of a size very close to that of other species.<br>
        Slimes are a colorful, squishy, blob-like people able to reshape their bodies at will. They have the ability to eat anything by absorbing it into their body, a very useful skill in the deserts of Nesoa where food is scarce. Slimes generally live in small tribes.<br>
        There's some sort of aquatic people on Ciphin. I should really think about those.<br>
        Fairies have horns or antlers and wings and pointy ears. The horns/antlers and wings can be from any creature. They can't have animal ears though.<br>
        Therians are a people able to change between a humanoid and animal form (and everything in between) at will. In their most humanlike form, they have animal ears and a tail, but otherwise look human.<br></p>

      <summary>What can the magic do?</summary>
        <p>A lot! The main thing it can do is enchanting, which imbues something with an aspect of one of the 6 elements (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Dark, Light) So for example, you could enchant a wall with the aspect "flows like Water", and it'll act like water in that way. I think it's a very simple, yet powerful magic system. You can also create and manipulate things associated with the elements you can use.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Wow! That magic system sounds really cool! Can anyone do magic?</summary>
        <p>Most people are only able to use one element. Humans can use all of them naturally, but their magic is weaker. Other species can use only one element naturally, but can learn to use other elements. Most of the natural elements are pretty obvious. The least obvious one is probably Slimes being air.</p>

      <summary>What does magic cost?</summary>
        <p>Magic costs magical energy, measured by the Enerk. One Enerk is the average amount of magical energy contained in the human body. Generally, the amount of energy contained in your body is enough for daily use. Using up all the magical energy in your body will cause you to pass out and sleep until you recover some of it. Repeatedly doing this has similar symptoms to sleep deprivation. Another common source of magical energy is magic crystals, which act as a magic battery. Depleting all the energy in one will cause it to violently shatter, often injuring the user. One can also use the magic energy of the world itself, but it is very weak in most areas.<br><br>
        There are also... <font color="purple"><i>darker</i></font> sources of magical energy. These are, to say the least, <i>frowned upon.</i>
        <br>
        These include that of <font color="maroon">life itself</font>, and that of <font color="darkslateblue">souls</font>. While <font color="maroon">life energy</font> is quite plentiful, with the average sentient being containing 10 Enerks of it, it does not regenerate, and using it all has <font color="purple"><i>consequences</i></font>. Using up all your <font color="maroon">life energy</font> at once simply kills you. <i>However,</i> using it up slowly turns one into an <font color="darkred">undead being</font>, <font color="cornsilk">eternally</font> cursed to seek the <font color="maroon">life energy</font> of the living. <font color="darkslateblue">Souls</font> are the most powerful of energy sources, often containing more than 100 Enerks of magical energy. They are oft sought by <font color="darkred">demonic beings</font> for <font color="purple">nefarious purposes</font>. Of course, <font color="darkred">demons</font> <i>are</i> known for making deals, and a <font color="darkslateblue">soul</font> isn't such a bad thing to give up for your heart's deepest desires. <font color="black"><i>All it does is sentence you to an eternity of nothing.</i></font>

      <summary>Do you need any kind of equipment to do magic? A cool wand or staff, maybe?</summary>
        <p>No, but many magic users will have something made with a magic crystal. Often, this will be some kind of jewelry, but a staff or wand isn't out of the question.</p>

      <summary>I have questions that aren't answered here. Where should I direct them to?</summary>
